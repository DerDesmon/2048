## 1. Game Overview
2048 is a popular puzzle game where the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid and combine them to reach the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and players can slide the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. As they move the tiles, new tiles with values of 2 or 4 appear randomly on the board. The game ends when the player successfully reaches the 2048 tile or when there are no more valid moves.

## 2. Game Rules
- The game is played on a 4x4 grid.
- The initial board contains two randomly placed tiles with a value of either 2 or 4.
- Players can slide the tiles in one of the four directions: up, down, left, or right.
- When tiles slide, they move as far as possible in the chosen direction until they hit the edge of the grid or another tile.
- If two tiles with the same value collide while sliding, they merge into a single tile with their sum. The value of the new tile is the sum of the two merged tiles.
- After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears randomly on an empty spot on the grid.
- The game ends when the player reaches the 2048 tile or when there are no more valid moves.

## 3. Game Mechanics
The game mechanics define the core functionality and behavior of the game. Here are the key mechanics of the 2048 game:
- Tile Generation: After each move, a new tile is generated on an empty spot with a value of 2 or 4.
- Tile Movement: The player can slide the tiles in one of the four directions. When a tile is moved, it continues moving in that direction until it hits the edge of the grid or another tile.
- Tile Merging: When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into a single tile with their sum. The resulting tile takes the place of one of the merged tiles, and the other tile is removed from the grid.
- Scoring: The player earns points whenever tiles are merged. The score is incremented by the value of the merged tiles.
- Win Condition: The player wins the game when they successfully reach the 2048 tile.
- Lose Condition: The player loses the game when there are no more valid moves available, i.e., the grid is full and no tiles can be merged or moved.

## 4. Controls
The game controls allow the player to interact with the game. Here are the controls for playing 2048:
- Arrow Keys: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to slide the tiles in the corresponding direction.
- W, A, S, D: Alternatively, you can use the W, A, S, D keys as well to slide the tiles.
